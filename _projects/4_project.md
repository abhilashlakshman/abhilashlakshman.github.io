phaseR is a work in progress software that I'm building which has all the amazing things [RhythmicAlly](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730419862474) and [PHASE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07487304221093114) can do, but in one place.

Its intended design is to be a one-stop shop for all rhythm visualizing and analyzing needs for _Drosophila_ data sets.

phaseR will soon be set to stun, so stay tuned!
