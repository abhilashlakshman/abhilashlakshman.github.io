RhythmicAlly is an entirely open-source, free, R and Shiny based app to visualize and analyze biological timeseries designed to help with detection of wide range of periodicities and across different animal/plant systems. The advantage of RhythmicAlly is that it is not really contingent upon how data was collected. As long as you have a time-series you'll be able to play around with it.

A major plus of this software is the ability of subjective marking of phases of behavior, which is, in many cases, required but available software programs don't let you do it. The only other alternative program that let's you do it is very expensive.
