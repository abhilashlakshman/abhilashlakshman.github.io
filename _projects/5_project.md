PHASE is a MATLAB based but free and standalone software for the analysis of _Drosophila_ **Ph**ase, **A**ctivity and **S**leep under **E**ntrainment.

The big advantage of this program is its ability to perform data smoothing using a Savitzky-Golay filter which consequently allows you to pick phases of behaviors in an objective manner, something that the _Drosophila_ field of circadian rhythms was lacing. PHASE also helps with somewhat more nuanced estimates of anticipation behavior.

I'm working on a video tutorial for PHASE. Until then please use this [user manual](https://abhilashlakshman.github.io/PHASE_SOM.pdf).
