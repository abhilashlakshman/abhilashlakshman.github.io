<i>"Why this absurd concern with clocks, my friend?" - Walter de la Mare</i>

I study the dynamics of the neural network underlying timing of behavior. Most of us are familiar with the physical discomfort and mental disarray that accompanies mistimed sleep.

I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the [Neuroscience Initiative](https://asrc.gc.cuny.edu/neuroscience/) of the [Advanced Science Research Center](https://asrc.gc.cuny.edu) at the [Graduate Center of the City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu). I work with [Prof. Orie Shafer](https://www.shaferlab.org) on understanding how animals keep time and how their internal circadian clocks regulate the timing and amount of sleep.



I did my undergraduate training in Zoology, Botany and Chemistry from the [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in) before moving to the [Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research](https://www.jncasr.ac.in) in Bangalore for my MS and Ph.D. As a graduate student, I was trained in chronobiology, population genetics and dynamics, animal behavior, behavioral neurogenetics and quantitative tools in biology.
